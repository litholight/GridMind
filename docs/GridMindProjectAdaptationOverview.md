### GridMind Project Adaptation Overview with Advanced C# Techniques

The following overview outlines the stages and adaptations necessary to transform GridMind into a complex agent-based environment, incorporating both AI and human interaction with limited information. This guide now includes where and how to utilize advanced C# techniques in each stage.

## Stage 1: Implement Limited Knowledge and Local Perception
**Goal**: Change the agent’s strategy to operate with only local knowledge, enabling it to “see” only cells within a specified radius. Maintain a fog of war for cells outside this radius.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Agent Perception**:
    - Modify the `Agent` class to include a `GetVisibleCells()` method that returns the visible cells based on its position and visibility radius.
    - Introduce a `FogOfWar` component in the `Grid` to track unexplored areas.

2. **Fog of War in Visualization**:
    - Modify `GridVisualizer` to display fogged areas and show cells as “unknown” until the agent has moved close enough to see them.
    - Keep track of explored cells using an `ExploredCells` property in the `Agent` class.

3. **Update Movement Strategies**:
    - Update existing strategies (`BreadthFirstSearchStrategy`, `RandomWalkStrategy`) to use the limited knowledge and only plan paths based on visible cells.

### Advanced C# Techniques for This Stage
1. **Extension Methods for Perception**:
    - Implement extension methods for `GridCell` to support visibility calculations (`IsWithinRadius`).

   ```csharp
   public static class GridExtensions
   {
       public static bool IsWithinRadius(this GridCell cell, GridCell origin, int radius)
       {
           int rowDist = Math.Abs(cell.Row - origin.Row);
           int colDist = Math.Abs(cell.Column - origin.Column);
           return rowDist <= radius && colDist <= radius;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Use of `HashSet` and LINQ**:
    - Store and access explored cells efficiently using `HashSet<GridCell>`.
    - Use LINQ for querying visible cells:

   ```csharp
   var visibleCells = grid.Cells
       .Where(cell => cell.IsWithinRadius(agent.Position, visibilityRadius))
       .ToList();
   ```

3. **Observer Pattern for Fog of War**:
    - Use the Observer Pattern to update the `GridVisualizer` whenever the `ExploredCells` set changes.

   ```csharp
   public class FogOfWar : IObservable<GridCell>
   {
       private readonly List<IObserver<GridCell>> observers = new List<IObserver<GridCell>>();

       public IDisposable Subscribe(IObserver<GridCell> observer)
       {
           observers.Add(observer);
           return new Unsubscriber(observers, observer);
       }

       public void CellExplored(GridCell cell)
       {
           foreach (var observer in observers)
               observer.OnNext(cell);
       }
   }
   ```

## Stage 2: Add Human Control Interface
**Goal**: Implement a way for a human player to take control of the agent and interact with the environment using the same information as the AI agent.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Create a Human Player Controller**:
    - Implement a new class `HumanController` that allows the user to take control of the agent’s movement.
    - Use keyboard or mouse inputs in the `VisualizerWindow` to set the movement direction.

2. **Integrate Human Control in the UI**:
    - Modify the `VisualizerWindow` to allow for keybindings that update the direction in `HumanController`.
    - Display the agent’s visible cells, obstacles, and fog of war in the UI.

3. **Switch Between AI and Human Control**:
    - Implement a way to dynamically switch between human and AI control using a menu option or a keybinding.

### Advanced C# Techniques for This Stage
1. **Command Pattern for Input Handling**:
    - Use the Command Pattern to encapsulate human input (e.g., movement directions) into reusable commands.
    - This allows for future features like undo/redo or macros.

   ```csharp
   public class MoveCommand : ICommand
   {
       private readonly Agent agent;
       private readonly MovementDirection direction;

       public MoveCommand(Agent agent, MovementDirection direction)
       {
           this.agent = agent;
           this.direction = direction;
       }

       public void Execute()
       {
           agent.Move(direction);
       }

       public void Undo()
       {
           // Logic to undo movement
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Reactive Programming for UI Updates**:
    - Use `ReactiveUI` patterns to dynamically update the grid based on human actions.

   ```csharp
   this.WhenAnyValue(x => x.agent.Position)
       .Subscribe(_ => GridVisualizerControl.UpdateAgentPosition());
   ```

3. **Event-Driven Programming**:
    - Use C# events to trigger visual updates and state changes when the human changes direction or switches control modes.

   ```csharp
   public event EventHandler<DirectionChangedEventArgs> DirectionChanged;
   ```

## Stage 3: Track and Compare Human and Agent Performance
**Goal**: Monitor metrics for both human and agent performance and compare them to identify strengths and weaknesses.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Define Performance Metrics**:
    - Track metrics such as:
        - Number of steps taken.
        - Cells explored.
        - Repeated cell visits.
        - Time to goal.

2. **Create a Performance Tracking Class**:
    - Implement a `PerformanceTracker` class that records these metrics for each agent and human session.

3. **Display Performance in the UI**:
    - Create a performance dashboard in the `VisualizerWindow` to show real-time metrics.

### Advanced C# Techniques for This Stage
1. **Observer Pattern for Performance Tracking**:
    - Use the Observer Pattern to notify the UI whenever a performance metric changes.

   ```csharp
   public class PerformanceTracker : IObservable<PerformanceMetrics>
   {
       private readonly List<IObserver<PerformanceMetrics>> observers = new();

       public IDisposable Subscribe(IObserver<PerformanceMetrics> observer)
       {
           observers.Add(observer);
           return new Unsubscriber<PerformanceMetrics>(observers, observer);
       }

       public void Notify(PerformanceMetrics metrics)
       {
           foreach (var observer in observers)
               observer.OnNext(metrics);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Dependency Injection**:
    - Use Dependency Injection to inject `PerformanceTracker` into different components (`Agent`, `HumanController`, etc.).

## Stage 4: Dynamically Increase Challenge
**Goal**: Adapt the environment to increase the challenge for both human and agent when the agent’s performance matches or exceeds the human’s.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Introduce Dynamic Obstacles**:
    - Make some obstacles move or disappear/reappear based on time or conditions.
    - Implement obstacle movement using `Task` or `async` patterns.

2. **Randomize Goal Position**:
    - Periodically move the goal to a new location, requiring the agent to adapt.

3. **Change Grid Size and Shape**:
    - Alter the grid dimensions (e.g., maze-like environments) to force both human and agent to adapt.

### Advanced C# Techniques for This Stage
1. **Async and Multithreading**:
    - Use `Task` and `async/await` for dynamic updates to the environment.

   ```csharp
   public async Task MoveObstaclesPeriodically(Grid grid)
   {
       while (true)
       {
           await Task.Delay(2000);
           grid.MoveObstacles();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Behavioral Design Patterns**:
    - Use the **State Pattern** to control different phases of difficulty (e.g., `EasyState`, `MediumState`, `HardState`).

3. **Spatial Partitioning and Optimization**:
    - Use spatial partitioning techniques like Quadtrees to efficiently handle dynamic obstacles and large environments.

## Stage 5: Advanced AI and Human Learning
**Goal**: Make the AI agent capable of learning from human behavior and dynamically adjust based on feedback.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Implement Imitation Learning**:
    - Allow the agent to observe human movements and create a behavior model.

2. **Reinforcement Learning**:
    - Implement reward-based learning algorithms to optimize the agent’s strategies.

### Advanced C# Techniques for This Stage
1. **Machine Learning Integration**:
    - Consider integrating C# machine learning libraries like `ML.NET` for more advanced learning behaviors.

2. **Strategy Pattern for Dynamic Learning**:
    - Use the Strategy Pattern to swap between different learning algorithms dynamically.
